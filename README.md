# Automata Theory Visualization

This web application visualizes various types of automata, including Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Context-Free Grammars (CFG), and Pushdown Automata (PDA). 

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Brandon-Automata-Website.git
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Brandon-Automata-Website
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application, and you can view it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
